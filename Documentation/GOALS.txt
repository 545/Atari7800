Project Goals:

1. Fully functioning Atari 7800
   Robotron will be used as a goal Cartridge. It is one of the most simple 
   cartridges to run
2. Fully functioning Atari 2600
   E.T. used as goal Cartridge

3. Other cartridge functionality (stretch goals):
   a. POKEY
   b. RAM on Cart
   c. Bankswitching? Need to look more into this
